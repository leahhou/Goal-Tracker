# Goal-Tracker
Bryce and Leah's terminal app


## Details of design & planning process

# Initial Idea
Initially, we each wrote two ideas for an terminal application onto a page. After staating our ideas we went through the potential for each idea and the challenges we could face in their development.

# IDEAS FOR APP:
#### IDEA ONE: PET MONITOR APP.

* Track Food consumed.
* Track excersize.
* Calculate Dietry requirements.
* Generate a 'BMI' for the users pet.
* Inform the user if their pet is unhealthy.

#### IDEA TWO: GOAL APP.

* List of goals.
* Aspirations.
* Reviewing goals.
* Offer fun reward for user when successful.
* Offer Encouragement for user when unsuccessful.

#### IDEA THREE: SHOPPING LIST APP.

* Takes user entry.
* Stores the entry into a list.
* Allows the user to modify list.
* - Delete items.
* - Add items.
* - Adjust quantities. 

#### IDEA FOUR: TRANSPORTATION
* Record user data
* Track the total time spent on transport
* Track average daily dollar amount spent on transport.
* Return the total time spent on transport for a period.
* Return the total dollar amount the user spends per period.


# Project Selection:

After brainstorming general ideas, we then gave each idea a ranking of '1 - 4' with '1' being the idea we wished to work on the most.
The idea with the lowest score would be the project we chose to develop further.

## Further planning and devlopment.

After deciding to move forward with the goal application we then took the elements we wished to implement and split them up into features that would be necessary for the minimum viable product( the 'MVP') and features that we considered extras(the 'sprinkles') and not needed for initial deployment.

#### MVP Features:
* User input
* User Goals
* Level of goals
* Time spent on task/action
* Reward for achieveing goal

#### Sprinkles
* Interactive Menu
* File loading and saving
* Tracking a goal over large time frames
* Ascii art for a reward.
* email reminder for entering goals
* track multiply goals at a time
