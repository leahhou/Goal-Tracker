# Goalnut (Terminal Application)

##### Link to Github repo: <https://github.com/leahhou/Goalnut>
# Purpose of the application

### People usually set goals at the beginning of the year as their new year resolutions, yet majority have fell to achieve them all. 
### There are multiple reasons it fails, such as:

* Setting unrealistic goals and they couldn’t meet their expectations
* Setting too many goals all at once
* Time management to action on them
* Lack of motivation to reach their goals
* Lack of support to reach their goals

### To resolve the issue outlined above, we would like to create the Goalnut application to provide solutions. Goalnuts can help the intended users to
* Set multiple goals, actions and track your progress on each goal
* Analyze their actions, progress and goals
* Analyze if they set their goal too high and they constantly could not make it
* Analyze if they allocate reasonable amount of time to achieving multiple goals
* Encourage their progress 
* Feel supported and get tips by get connected  to other Goalnut members who have similar goals

# Intended users of applications
### Inclusive to all members in general public. 
### Visually impaired and illiterate users are allowed to use the application.

     
# Possible impact of the application
## A. Possible Positive social impact
* The application is created to help people feel positive about their accomplishment when achieving the goal
* Implement members with useful tools to ahieve their goals
* Building a community to help each other achieving what they would like to achieve

## B. Possible misuse of Goalnut
* The sense of community should be carefully designed for encouragement and support, and should not be used to increase unnecesarry competition.
* Goalnut used should be correctly encouraged, rather than being criticized if they haven't achieve their goals


# Major feature of the application (MVP)
##### (Given the constraint of time to the project (2 days), we focuses on building four major features of Goalnut)
#### Feature One: Goal Setting
### The application allows users to set ONE goal. For example, a goal could be to "exercise more this year".

#### Feature Two: Action Setting
### The application allows users to set : 
* One action they would like to do to achieve their goal, such as "jogging".
* Set the expected frequency of the action, such as "3 times a week" 
* Set the expected duration of the action, such as "30 mins jogging" 

#### Feature Three: Action Logging per week
* Log in all activities once a week, recoding: times of actions executed, and duration of each action
#### Feature Four: Track Progress and give reward per week
* Calculate how many percentage the users have hit in achieving their goals. For example, "80% of time you have run 30 mins this week" 
* Give average of your actions. For example, "on average, you have run 20 mins this week"
* Give ascci donut artwork as rewards when goals achieved
* Give encouragement words when goals haven’t achieved
# Additional features of the application
* Files load/save: the users log out and their previous inputs are saved
* Set multiple goals 
* Set multiple actions to achieve their goals. For example, setting swimming, jogging and gym towards the goal:exercise more
* Set the period they would like to compare their actions
* Be able to keep track for a month, or a quarter or a year
* Email: sending automatic emails to remind logging in their actions
* Use text to speech to allow visually impaired and illiterate users to use app.
* Application users would be able to connect with each other and share their experience
* Applications users can support each other and share tips in achieving their goals
